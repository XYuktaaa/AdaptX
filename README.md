# AdaptX
Web accessibility ,that is making the website accessible,inclusive and useful for everyone including the people with disabilities , is not something many developers focus on. AdaptX is a one stop platform for developers with integrated cutting edge ai technology features which will assist them in developing web accessible websites. It not only lists the features that the developers should implement in their projects but also provides them with a demo of the same as well as the required code. The intention is to include features targeting  various types of disabilities including mobility issues, vision problems, autism and many more that are usually not targeted while making a project - all at a single platform. Some of the key features include text to audio converter, focused navigation, braille supporter etc  Whether it's a hackathon or your personal project you can make your project stand out by using our features and at the same time doing something for a greater cause.
